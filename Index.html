            <h2>Turtle Race Game </h2><br>
            <p>Developed an interactive racing game using Python’s Turtle Graphics module and implemented turtle movement using randomization for an unpredictable race outcome, where users can bet on different colored turtles and watch them compete in a race. The project focuses on user engagement through predictions, providing a fun and visually appealing interface.

            <h2>Coffee Machine</h2><br>
            <p>Built a Python-based coffee vending machine program that allows users to place orders from a predefined menu, processes payments, and manages available resources dynamically. The program ensures smooth functioning by tracking ingredient levels and account balance in real time. I made this by making user-defined functions for each section of task and also made it efficient to understand by the others.

            <h2>BlackJack Game</h2><br>
            <p>Developed an interactive Blackjack card game in Python, where the user competes against the computer. The game follows standard Blackjack rules, providing an engaging and enjoyable experience with automated decision-making by the computer. Here, I have implemented card deck logic with randomization for realistic gameplay and designed user vs. computer interaction with automated computer strategies coded in Python also built a scoring system to determine winners, ensuring fairness and excitement.
